# Learning Electronics
## Author: Aaron Chamberlain

This repository holds simple circuit boards that are great for learning about electronics. Simply navigate to the individual folders for each project. In them, you will find the EAGLE board, schematic, and project files. In some cases there will be two versions, one to be milled on a CNC (I use the Bantam Tools CNC Machine to test these) and another to be manufactured by a service like OSHPARK. Both versions cant be sent to a manufacturer, but the CNC versions are not optimal because I often leave out vias, which are difficult to make on a milled board.

## Projects:
[Transistor Logic][logic]: This circuit is a simple implementation of the 4 basic logic gates, AND, OR, NOR, and NAND.
