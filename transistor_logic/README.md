# Transistor Logic
This circuit is a simple implementation of the 4 basic logic gates, AND, OR, NOR, and NAND.

At this time, the circuit only has a version designed for a CNC machine. I will consider making a different version for fabrication with good silkscreens.

Bill of Materials (The Stuff You Need to Make This):
I recommend using Digikey or Mouser to find these products, I will try to provide part-numbers for them when possible.

1 9V Battery or Power Supply
1 8-Pin DIP Switch
8 3904 NPN Transistors
8 10K 1/2W Resistors
4 4.7K 1/2W Resistors
4 120R 1/2W Resistors
4 5mm LEDs of your choice

Note that it it recommended to change the resistor value of the 120R resistor if you change the LED color. I chose 120R because it's roughly middle of the road and what I needed for 4 green LEDs.
